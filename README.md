This project was started from scratch, following this tutorial: https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-webpack-babel/

To learn TypeScript, I followed this video tutorial and took notes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBPrJSw7yQA 

## Next steps: 
- Convert work already done to use TypeScript, and setup relative scripts (below) - watch, build, start. Use TypeScript, Babel & Webpack.
- Continue tutorial on how to integrate Redux into solution
- Create backend API / web service that reads, writes, and deletes records from an SQL database. 
- Finish React Tutorials
- Look into imtegrating Jest

Profile.Backend folder also contains a VS 2017 ASP.NET project, which (will eventually) utilizes XUnit Testing, Swagger, API implementation, and SQL Database integration. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
